# CS51-Algorithms-and-Simulations

### Part 1
Using sklearn to train and test a model for diagnosing individuals with disease based on factors: temperature, WBC count, headache severity, and cough severity.

### Part 2
Simulating the spread of disease through a population based on parameters from part 1, including the change in number of people surviving, infected, recovered, died, and vaccinated. Simulations:
* Euler's method to give a discrete approximation.
* Agent-based model (ABM) using packages: networkx, EoN, collections (see GIF in repository for results of ABM).
